#invisiblity

invisibility is a protection cloack
i have worn it everyday in my life as a protection
now i don't know how to become visible without being timid
i need a lot of practice
but how to practice?

1.practice speaking up for yourself
2.make your own choices and don't shy away
3.involve in new activities
